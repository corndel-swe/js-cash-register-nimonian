Welcome to the cash register project!

A few things you should know:

- The functions in `lib` are designed to work with a "drawer" full of money.
  Take a look at `drawer.js` to see what one looks like.

- Currency is in USD: penny, nickel, dime and quarter are coins; everything else
  is a note

- Value is always given as an integer in cents, and never a decimal, so a
  `value` of `210` means $2.10.

- Debugging! You will probably want to do some `console.log` to debug. The
  `drawer.js` has been imported into each file, so you can do, for example

  ```js
  // level-1.js
  removeItem('penny', drawer)
  console.log(drawer)
  ```

  then run

  ```bash
  node lib/level-1.js
  ```

  to see what happens.

- Just make sure to remove the `console.log` before you test, commit, push!
  Don't want to leave a bunch of logs clogging up the place :wood:

If you're happy with all this, open up `TODO.md` and have fun!
